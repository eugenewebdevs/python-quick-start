# Python for non Programmer Professionals

## Description

If you wanted to learn python to write scripts for use in your non programmer profession then this quick start workshop will get you on that path. This an hour workshop focused on just the very very basics of python. We will provide a small slide show and example code you a run and edit to help you get going. Programmers will also be on hand to answer any questions. This is not a start to programming in python as a profession, instead this is for non programming professionals that could use python in their professional tools.

## All About

This is a (very) quick course on python. The goal is to learn some basics in about a like an hour. ‚è∞

This is NOT the best way to learn python if you are looking to write professional production python. 

This is a more simple approach meant for those creating basic instructional scripting for tools that accept python as an instruction interface.

The power of scripting is scaling tasks. The repetitive and tedious tasks are perfect for machines. Not so much for humans. What could take a human hours to complete a machine can in seconds. This of course is dependant on clear precise instruction. This is where python comes in. üêç

In this course will only be running single files. As applications get complicated there will be more files involved. Remember this is a skill, and you're not supposed to get this overnight. people make careers from years of experiences with this knowledge. Take your time.

Some terms that are important:

- List: A built-in Python sequence. Despite its name it is more akin to an array in other languages. üìô
- local: This is your computer. üíª 
- function: A series of statements which returns some value to a caller. ‚öôÔ∏è

## Use

### Online

We can run any of the code in this course online. You don't have to install anything. 

Create an account at [https://www.mycompiler.io/](https://www.mycompiler.io/) to run code for free!

Just visit provided links and hit run to execute the code, or "fork" (this means copy to your account )and edit your copy the code with new changes.

[Online - hello.py](https://www.mycompiler.io/view/DAzSLjGr0mH)

Success will have additional print out `[Execution complete with exit code 0]`.

If there is an error with the code, a description of the error and a differing code will be printed out.

### In Command Line

##### Local installs

You can run any of ths code on your machine as well.

On your machine we will be using the command line to run our python.

This is Terminal in mac and some other thing in Win(I don't have a windows machine... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø ).

(what is this? add hacker joke here)`

Verify python is installed in command line run: 

`python3 -v`

Should return something like:

`Python 3.9.13`

If you don't have python:

- python3 installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/

To Run a python file we can run the hello.py file in this repo

`python3 hello.py`
